        "abstract": "We introduce LION, a novel sequence-to-sequence framework that unifies the bidirectionality and parallelized training of Transformers with the fast inference of recurrent neural networks. LION is built upon a mathematical formulation where full kernelized attention with a learnable mask is efficiently computed using a bidirectional selective recurrent model, matching the effectiveness of softmax-based attention with constant-time inference. Our framework naturally accounts for spatial and temporal relationships within input sequences, reducing reliance on heuristic positional embeddings and facilitating straightforward scalability in context length and resolution. Using our framework and inspired by the recent state-space models, we propose LION-S, a transformer with $selective$ mask and recurrent inference. Numerical evaluations on tasks such as language modeling, the Long-Range Arena, and image classification show that LION-S achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art models while delivering superior inference efficiency."

        "abstract": "In black-box optimization, when directly evaluating the function values of solutions is very costly or infeasible, access to the objective function is often limited to comparing pairs of solutions, which yields dueling black-box optimization. Dueling optimization is solely based on pairwise preferences, and thus notably reduces cost compared with function value based methods such as Bayesian optimization. However, an optimization performance gap obviously exists between dueling based and function value based methods. This is mainly due to that most existing dueling optimization methods do not make full use of the pairwise preferences collected. To fill this gap, this paper proposes relation augmented preferential Bayesian optimization (RAPBO) via preference propagation. By considering solution similarity, RAPBO aims to uncover the potential preferential relations between solutions within different preferences through the proposed preferential relation propagation technique. Specifically, RAPBO first clusters solutions using a Gaussian mixture model. After obtaining the solution set with the highest intra-cluster similarity, RAPBO utilizes a directed hypergraph to model the potential relations between solutions, thereby realizing relation augmentation. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic functions and real-world tasks such as motion control and spacecraft trajectory optimization. The experimental results disclose the satisfactory accuracy of augmented preferences in RAPBO, and show the superiority of RAPBO compared with existing dueling optimization methods. Notably, it is verified that, under the same evaluation cost budget, RAPBO is competitive with or even surpass the function value based Bayesian optimization methods with respect to optimization performance.

To this end, watermarking has been adapted to LLM, enabling a simple and effective way to detect and monitor generated text. However, while the existing methods can differentiate between watermarked and unwatermarked text with high accuracy, they often face a trade-off between the quality of the generated text and the effectiveness of the watermarking process. In this work, we present a novel type of LLM watermark,Sparse Watermark, which aims to mitigate this trade-off by applying watermarks to a small subset of generated tokens distributed across the text. To demonstrate this type of watermark, we introduceSpARK, aSparse WatermARKmethod that achieves sparsity by anchoring watermarked tokens to words that have specific Part-of-Speech (POS) tags. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed watermarking scheme achieves high detectability while generating text that outperforms previous LLM watermarking methods in quality across various tasks."

In this paper, we introduce SSDE, a novel structure-based method that aims to improve plasticity through a fine-grained allocation strategy with Structured Sparsity and Dormant-guided Exploration. Specifically, SSDE decomposes the parameter space for each task into forward-transfer (frozen) parameters and task-specific (trainable) parameters. Crucially, these parameters are allocated by an efficient co-allocation scheme under sparse coding, ensuring sufficient trainable capacity for new tasks while promoting efficient forward transfer through frozen parameters. Furthermore, structure-based methods often suffer from rigidity due to the accumulation of non-trainable parameters, hindering exploration. To overcome this, we propose a novel exploration technique based on sensitivity-guided dormant neurons, which systematically identifies and resets insensitive parameters. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SSDE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and achieves a superior success rate of $95%$% on CW10 Continual World benchmark."

We introduce a simple metric, Block Redundancy (BR), to detect redundant blocks, providing a foundation for future architectural optimization methods. Building on this, we propose Redundant Blocks Approximation (RBA), a general framework that identifies and approximates one or more redundant computational blocks using simpler transformations. We show that the transformation $\\mathcal{T}$ between two representations can be efficiently computed in closed-form, and it is enough to replace the redundant blocks from the network. RBA reduces model parameters and time complexity while maintaining good performance. We validate our method on classification tasks in the vision domain, using a variety of pretrained foundational models and datasets."

        "abstract": "When solving challenging problems, language models (LMs) are able to identify relevant information from long and complicated contexts. To study how LMs solve retrieval tasks in diverse situations, we introduce ORION, a collection of structured retrieval tasks spanning six domains, from text understanding to coding. Each task in ORION can be represented abstractly by a request (e.g. a question) that retrieves an attribute (e.g. the character name) from a context (e.g. a story). We apply causal analysis on 18 open-source language models with sizes ranging from 125 million to 70 billion parameters. We find that LMs internally decompose retrieval tasks in a modular way: middle layers at the last token position process the request, while late layers retrieve the correct entity from the context. After causally enforcing this decomposition, models are still able to solve the original task, preserving 70% of the original correct token probability in 98 of the 106 studied model-task pairs. We connect our macroscopic decomposition with a microscopic description by performing a fine-grained case study of a question-answering task on Pythia-2.8b. Building on our high-level understanding, we demonstrate a proof of concept application for scalable internal oversight of LMs to mitigate prompt-injection while requiring human supervision on only a single input. Our solution improves accuracy drastically (from 15.5% to 97.5% on Pythia-12b). This work presents evidence of a universal emergent modular processing of tasks across varied domains and models and is a pioneering effort in applying interpretability for scalable internal oversight of LMs."

The core idea behind our framework is to learn conditional distribution of local image patterns given their global context. Thus, image patterns that have low conditional probability are assigned high anomaly scores.\nTo this end, we propose Screener comprised of descriptor,  condition, and density models.\nThe descriptor model encodes local image patterns into dense self-supervised representations. We enforce these descriptors to discriminate different image positions and remain invariant w.r.t. image augmentations that preserve local content.\nThe condition model produces auxiliary dense image representations, which we call conditions. We ensure that conditions encode the global contexts of individual image positions, by enforcing them to be invariant w.r.t. image masking.\nAt last, the density model learns the conditional density of descriptors for each given condition and produces anomaly segmentation scores.\nWe use this framework to train a fully self-supervised model for pathology segmentation on more than 30,000 3D CT images. Empirical study shows that Screener outperforms the existing unsupervised anomaly segmentation methods on four large-scale test CT datasets containing a total of 1820 3D images with four chest and abdominal pathologies."

In this paper, we derive an empirical law that predicts pretraining loss for large language models for every intermediate training step across various learning rate schedules, including constant, cosine, and step decay schedules. Our proposed law takes a multi-power form, combining a power law based on the sum of learning rates and additional power laws to account for a loss reduction effect as learning rate decays. We validate this law extensively on Llama-2 models of varying sizes and demonstrate that, after fitting on a few learning rate schedules, it accurately predicts the loss curves for unseen schedules of different shapes and horizons. Moreover, by minimizing the predicted final pretraining loss across learning rate schedules, we are able to find a schedule that outperforms the widely-used cosine learning rate schedule. Interestingly, this automatically discovered schedule bears some resemblance to the recently proposed Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) schedule (hu et al, 2024) but achieves slightly faster convergence. We believe these results could offer valuable insights for understanding the dynamics of pretraining and for designing learning rate schedules to improve efficiency."

        "abstract": "The advent of real-time large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4o has sparked considerable interest in efficient LMMs. LMM frameworks typically encode visual inputs into vision tokens (continuous representations) and integrate them and textual instructions into the context of large language models (LLMs), where large-scale parameters and numerous context tokens (predominantly vision tokens) result in substantial computational overhead. Previous efforts towards efficient LMMs always focus on replacing the LLM backbone with smaller models, while neglecting the crucial issue of token quantity. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal vision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while preserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision tokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early layers, where they fuse visual information into text tokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to fuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the extreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token. LLaVAMini can support the understanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient manner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token instead of 576. Efficiency analyses reveal that LLaVA-Mini can reduce FLOPs by 77%, deliver low-latency responses within 40 milliseconds, and process over 10,000 frames of video on GPU hardware with 24GB of memory."

Our model, abbreviated as URLOST, combines a learnable self-organizing layer, spectral clustering, and a masked autoencoder (MAE). We evaluate its effectiveness on three diverse data modalities including simulated biological vision data, neural recordings from the primary visual cortex, and gene expressions. Compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised learning methods like SimCLR and MAE, our model excels at learning meaningful representations across diverse modalities without knowing their stationarity or topology. It also outperforms other methods that are not dependent on these factors, setting a new benchmark in the field.

This paper unleashes a framework that empowers backdoor researchers to effortlessly create a malicious, physical backdoor dataset based on advances in generative modeling. Particularly, this framework involves 3 automatic modules: suggesting the suitable physical triggers, generating the poisoned candidate samples (either by synthesizing new samples or editing existing clean samples), and finally refining for the most plausible ones. As such, it effectively mitigates the perceived complexity associated with creating a physical backdoor dataset, transforming it from a daunting task into an attainable objective. Extensive experiment results show that datasets created by our framework enable researchers to achieve an impressive attack success rate on real physical world data and exhibit similar properties compared to previous physical backdoor attack studies.

However, LLMs are still prone to generating hallucinationsâ€”results that are factually inconsistent or uncertain. As a result, the need for datasets to evaluate and demonstrate the hallucination detection capabilities of LLMs is increasingly recognized. Nonetheless, the Korean NLP community lacks publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrating the factuality of knowledge-based information. Furthermore, the few existing datasets that evaluate hallucination are limited in their access to the entire dataset, restricting detailed analysis beyond simple scoring, and are based on translated English knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce K-HALU, a Korean benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' hallucination detection in Korean. This benchmark contains seven domains, considering the factuality of statements based on knowledge documents compiled from Korean news, magazines, and books. For more strict evaluation, 40% of the dataset is structured as multiple-answer questions, requiring models to select all possible correct answers from the given options. Our empirical results show that open-source LLMs still struggle with hallucination detection in Korean knowledge, emphasizing the need for a more detailed analysis of their limitations. The K-HALU benchmark will be made publicly available after the anonymous review period."

The blue team has access to a weakertrustedmodel and a limited amount of high-quality, trusted labor to attempt to safely extract work from a strongeruntrustedmodel. Prior work conducted a control evaluation using competition programming problems with the red team objective of writing subtly incorrect (or \"backdoored\") solutions (Greenblatt et al. 2023). We extend this work by performing a control evaluation in a more realistic setting in which an untrusted LLM agent executes commands in a bash shell. The blue team seeks to use that agent to complete our novel dataset of 200 challenging multi-step tasks, each of which requires the agent to iteratively develop a bash script that passes test cases. The red team creates an attack policy that uses the untrusted model to covertly download and execute a dummy malware file while completing tasks without getting caught by the blue team's safety protocols. This agentic setting allows both teams to explore complex new strategies that have not been previously studied. We extend protocols from previous work to this agentic setting, propose novel protocols, and evaluate each on our safety and usefulness metrics. We find that our protocols substantially improve the Pareto frontier of usefulness and safety relative to simple baselines: one of our best protocols exhibits approximately a 2.5 times improvement in safety metrics with no statistically significant decrease in usefulness compared to our trusted monitoring baseline."

This is surprising because GD training on a single task is implicitly biased towards the individual max-margin solution for the task, and the direction of the joint max-margin solution can be largely different from these individual solutions. Additionally, when tasks are given in a cyclic order, we present a non-asymptotic analysis on cycle-averaged forgetting, revealing that (1) task similarity is indeed closely tied to catastrophic forgetting and backward knowledge transfer and (2) the amount of forgetting vanishes to zero as the cycle repeats. Lastly, we analyze the case where the tasks are no longer jointly separable and show that the model trained in a cyclic order converges to the unique minimum of the joint loss function."

        "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive generalization due to training on vast datasets like ImageNet. However, their performance diminishes on unfamiliar tasks. While downstream fine-tuning enhances adaptability, it often sacrifices inherent generality. To address this, we propose a novel method leveraging contextual generation for enhanced task representation within a semantic space. Our approach utilizes VLMs to generate detailed contextual descriptions for test image batches, developing Contextual Kernels (CK) for each class in the semantic space. \nOur test-time fine-tuning preserves core VLM features by freezing fundamental components and extending a linear network for semantic kernel density projection. This strategy significantly boosts model adaptability for real-world tasks. Despite strong zero-shot capabilities, we explore additional training samples to improve adaptability in dynamic Task Incremental Learning (TIL) scenarios. Each task's unique CK distribution serves as a fingerprint, enabling high-performance TIL with minimal forgetting. Experiments on four TIL datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our findings reveal that the semantic space within the text mode encapsulates both VLMs' generality and adaptability, paving the way for robust applications in diverse, evolving task environments. This work systematically balances generality and adaptability in VLMs, addressing a critical gap in current research."

        "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are renowned for their ability to generate highly realistic and diverse data samples. However, the performance of GANs is heavily dependent on the choice of loss functions, and commonly used losses such as cross-entropy and least squares are often susceptible to outliers, vanishing gradients, and training instability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce zephyr lossâ€”a novel, convex, smooth, and Lipschitz continuous loss function designed to enhance robustness and provide flexible gradient control. Leveraging this new loss function, we propose ZGAN, a refined GAN model that guarantees a unique optimal discriminator and stabilizes the overall training dynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizing ZGAN's generator objective minimizes a weighted total variation between the real and generated data distributions. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, including convergence proofs, we substantiate the robustness and effectiveness of ZGAN, positioning it as a compelling and reliable alternative for stable GAN training. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that ZGAN surpasses leading methods in generative modeling."

        "abstract": "The application of language models (LMs) to molecular structure generation using line notations such as SMILES and SELFIES has been well-established in the field of cheminformatics. However, extending these models to generate 3D molecular structures presents significant challenges. Two primary obstacles emerge: (1) the difficulty in designing a 3D line notation that ensures SE(3)-invariant atomic coordinates, and (2) the non-trivial task of tokenizing continuous coordinates for use in LMs, which inherently require discrete inputs.\nTo address these challenges, we propose Mol-StrucTok, a novel method for tokenizing 3D molecular structures. Our approach comprises two key innovations: (1) We design a line notation for 3D molecules by extracting local atomic coordinates in a spherical coordinate system. This notation builds upon existing 2D line notations and remains agnostic to their specific forms, ensuring compatibility with various molecular representation schemes. (2) We employ a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to tokenize these coordinates, treating them as generation descriptors. To further enhance the representation, we incorporate neighborhood bond lengths and bond angles as understanding descriptors. Leveraging this tokenization framework, we train a GPT-2 style model for 3D molecular generation tasks. Results demonstrate strong performance with significantly faster generation speeds and competitive chemical stability compared to previous methods. \nFurther, by integrating our learned discrete representations into Graphormer model for property prediction on QM9 dataset, Mol-StrucTok reveals consistent improvements across various molecular properties, underscoring the versatility and robustness of our approach."

        "abstract": "Reasoning is central to a wide range of intellectual activities, and while the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their performance in reasoning tasks remains limited. The processes and mechanisms underlying reasoning are not yet fully understood, but key elements include path exploration, selection of relevant knowledge, and multi-step inference. Problems are solved through the synthesis of these components. In this paper, we propose a benchmark that focuses on a specific aspect of reasoning ability: the direct evaluation of multi-step inference. To this end, we design an extreme reasoning task where multi-step inference is specifically focused by largely eliminating path exploration and implicit knowledge utilization. Our dataset comprises pairs of explicit instructions and corresponding questions, where the procedures necessary for solving the questions are entirely detailed within the instructions. This setup allows models to solve problems solely by following the provided directives. By constructing problems that require varying numbers of steps to solve and evaluating responses at each step, we enable a thorough assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs' ability to follow instructions. To ensure the robustness of our evaluation, we include multiple distinct tasks. Furthermore, by comparing accuracy across tasks, utilizing step-aware metrics, and applying separately defined measures of complexity, we conduct experiments that offer insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in reasoning tasks. Our findings have significant implications for the development of LLMs and highlight areas for future research in advancing their reasoning abilities."

        "abstract": "Diffusion models have significantly advanced generative AI  in terms of creating and editing naturalistic images. \nHowever, improving the image quality of generated images is still of paramount interest.\nIn this context, we propose a generic kurtosis concentration (KC) loss, which can be readily applied to any standard diffusion model pipeline to improve image quality.  Our motivation stems from the \\emph{projected kurtosis concentration property} of natural images, which states that natural images have nearly constant kurtosis values across different band-pass versions of the image. To improve the image quality of generated images, we reduce the gap between the highest and lowest kurtosis values across the band-pass versions (e.g., Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)) of images. In addition, we also propose a novel condition-agnostic perceptual guidance strategy during inference to further improve the image quality. We validate the proposed approach for three diverse tasks, viz., (1) personalized few-shot finetuning using text guidance, (2) unconditional image generation, and (3) image super-resolution. Integrating the proposed KC loss and perceptual guidance has improved the perceptual quality across all these tasks in terms of FID, MUSIQ score, and user evaluation. Code is provided in appendix."

        "abstract": "We propose a new model for multi-token prediction in transformers, aiming to enhance sampling efficiency without compromising accuracy. Motivated by recent work that predicts the probabilities of subsequent tokens using multiple heads, we connect this approach to rank-1 canonical tensor decomposition. By generalizing it to a rank-r canonical probability decomposition, we develop an improved model that predicts multiple tokens simultaneously. This model can also be interpreted as a mixture of experts, allowing us to leverage successful techniques from that domain for efficient and robust training. Importantly, the overall overhead for training and sampling remains low. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in inference speed for both text and code generation tasks, proving particularly beneficial within the self-speculative decoding paradigm. It maintains its effectiveness across various model sizes and training epochs, highlighting its robustness and scalability."
