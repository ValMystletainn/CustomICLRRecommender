        "abstract": "A decision-making agent, such as a robot, must observe and react to any new task-relevant information that becomes available from its environment. We seek to study a fundamental scientific question: what value does sensory information hold to an agent at various moments in time during the execution of a task? Towards this, we empirically study agents of varying architectures, generated with varying policy synthesis approaches (imitation, RL, model-based control), on diverse robotics tasks. For each robotic agent, we characterize its regret in terms of performance degradation when state observations are withheld from it at various task states for varying lengths of time. We find that sensory information is surprisingly rarely task-critical in many commonly studied task setups. Task characteristics such as stochastic dynamics largely dictate the value of sensory information for a well-trained robot; policy architectures such as planning vs. reactive control generate more nuanced second-order effects. Further, sensing efficiency is curiously correlated with task proficiency: in particular, fully trained high-performing agents are more robust to sensor loss than novice agents early in their training. Overall, our findings characterize the tradeoffs between sensory information and task performance in practical sequential decision making tasks, and pave the way towards the design of more resource-efficient decision-making agents."

We evaluate the efficacy of GOttack across multiple prominent GNN architectures using standard benchmark datasets.

        "abstract": "Understanding the inner workings of large-scale deep neural networks is challenging yet crucial in several high-stakes applications. Mechanistic interpretability is an emergent field that tackles this challenge, often by identifying human-understandable subgraphs in deep neural networks known as circuits. In vision-pretrained models, these subgraphs are typically interpreted by visualizing their node features through a popular technique called feature visualization. Recent works have analyzed the stability of different feature visualization types under the adversarial model manipulation framework. This paper addresses limitations in existing works by proposing a novel attack called ProxPulse that simultaneously manipulates two types of feature visualizations. Surprisingly, when analyzing these attacks within the context of visual circuits, we find that visual circuits exhibit some robustness to ProxPulse. Consequently, we introduce a new attack based on ProxPulse that reveals the manipulability of visual circuits, highlighting their lack of robustness. The effectiveness of these attacks is validated across a range of pre-trained models, from smaller architectures like AlexNet to medium-scale models like ResNet-50, and larger ones such as ResNet-152 and DenseNet-201 on the ImageNet dataset."

We present \\emph{Proto Successor Measure}: the basis set for all possible solutions of Reinforcement Learning in a dynamical system. We provably show that any possible policy can be represented using an affine combination of these policy independent basis functions. Given a reward function at test time, we simply need to find the right set of linear weights to combine these basis corresponding to the optimal policy.  We derive a practical algorithm to learn these basis functions using only interaction data from the environment and show that our approach can produce the optimal policy at test time for any given reward function without additional environmental interactions."

Do visual representations in deep network models converge with visual representations in humans? Here, we investigate this question for a new class of effective self-supervised models: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs). We compare image MAEs and video MAEs to neural responses in humans as well as convolutional neural networks. The results reveal that representations learned by MAEs diverge from neural representations in humans and convolutional neural networks. Fine-tuning MAEs with a supervised task improves their correspondence with neural responses but is not sufficient to bridge the gap that separates them from supervised convolutional networks. Finally, video MAEs show closer correspondence to neural representations than image MAEs, revealing an important role of temporal information. However, convolutional networks based on optic flow show a closer correspondence to neural responses in humans than even video MAEs, indicating that while masked autoencoding yields visual representations that are effective at multiple downstream tasks, it is not sufficient to learn representations that converge with human vision."

Our foundation model is specifically trained to utilize examples from multiple related time-series in its context window (in addition to the history of the target time-series) to help it adapt to the specific distribution of the target domain at inference time.  We show that such a foundation model that uses in-context examples  at inference time can obtain much better performance on popular forecasting benchmarks compared to supervised deep learning methods, statistical models as well as other time-series foundation models.

To address this limitation, we introduce JudgeRank, a novel agentic reranker that emulates human cognitive processes when assessing document relevance. Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) query analysis to identify the core problem, (2) document analysis to extract a query-aware summary, and (3) relevance judgment to provide a concise assessment of document relevance. We evaluate JudgeRank on the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, demonstrating substantial performance improvements over first-stage retrieval methods and outperforming other popular reranking approaches. In addition, JudgeRank performs on par with fine-tuned state-of-the-art rerankers on the popular BEIR benchmark, validating its zero-shot generalization capability. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that JudgeRank's performance generalizes well across LLMs of various sizes while ensembling them yields even more accurate reranking than individual models."

In this pursuit, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a potential source of transparency in LLMs. While CoT reasoning is appealing to humans, prior studies have shown that these reasoning chains are not faithful i.e.; they do not accurately reflect the underlying LLM's behavior. Ensuring the faithfulness of LLM-generated CoT reasoning is crucial for decision-makers, who rely on them to determine if, when, and to what extent, trust the recommendations made by these models. While several works proposed strategies to enhance accuracy and truthfulness in LLMs, there has been a lack of exploration on the effectiveness of these common strategies to enhance the faithfulness of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Specifically, we explore the promise of in-context learning, fine-tuning, and activation editing to improve the faithfulness of the CoT reasoning. Our empirical analyses on benchmark tasks indicate that these strategies offer limited success in improving the faithfulness of the CoT reasoning, with only slight performance enhancements in controlled scenarios. Activation editing demonstrated minimal success, while fine-tuning and in-context learning achieved marginal improvements that failed to generalize across reasoning and truthful question-answering benchmarks. We subsequently analyse what makes faithful CoT reasoning challenging, and present findings to lay the groundwork for future research in trustworthy reasoning from LLMs.  In summary, our work underscores the inherent difficulty in eliciting faithful CoT reasoning from LLMs, suggesting that the current array of approaches may not be sufficient to address this challenge."

Yet, deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream. Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference in component response profiles across the three visual streams—identifying components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. We find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with ventral than either dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of representational alignment that is sensitive to a system’s underlying axes of neural tuning."

Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) is a recently proposed approach that combines pre-trained multimodal LLMs such as vision-language models with federated learning to create personalized, privacy-preserving AI systems. However, balancing the competing goals of personalization, generalization, and privacy remains a significant challenge. Over-personalization can lead to overfitting, reducing generalizability, while stringent privacy measures, such as differential privacy, can hinder both personalization and generalization. In this paper, we propose a Differentially Private Federated Prompt Learning (DP-FPL) approach to tackle this challenge by leveraging a low-rank adaptation scheme to capture generalization while maintaining a residual term that preserves expressiveness for personalization. To ensure privacy, we introduce a novel method where we apply local differential privacy to the two low-rank components of the local prompt, and global differential privacy to the global prompt. Our approach mitigates the impact of privacy noise on the model performance while balancing the tradeoff between personalization and generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over other benchmarks."

In contrast, in large language models (LLM) this collaborative data and behavioral entities(users/items) are not well represented as they are not textual and are specific to the recommendation system/product. Bridging this gap between behavioral understanding and language understanding can enable new item and language interleaved tasks. In our work we show how we can efficiently adapt rich behavioral embeddings as an additional behavioral input representation in pre-trained LLMs. To achieve this we adapt Querying Transformer technique with a new item contrastive loss and show improved item-text joint understanding in PALM2.

        "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly involved in human society, some studies try to evaluate LLMs' capability of theory of mind (ToM), which is about the understanding and reasoning of others' mental states and possible actions. However, these previous works simplify the ToM capability required in real social contexts during their evaluations. This can be reflected in three aspects: (1) most evaluations focus on astatic mental stateafter several social scenarios while ignoring the changes of mental states across different scenarios; (2) they mainly considerindependent mental states, however different kinds of mental states (beliefs, intentions, and emotions) and actions can influence one another in our real life; (3) there is anabsence of social settings and character profilesin their evaluation, even though humans can effortlessly obtain and utilize this information in ToM reasoning processes. This lack can underestimate the abilities of LLMs. This paper aims to evaluate LLMs' ToM capability in closer alignment with a realistic social context.\nCorrespondingly, we propose a new benchmark, namedToMValley, which alleviates the limitations mentioned above of previous works. Specifically, the benchmark is constructed using a framework that includes four steps: social background determination, mental state sketch, social scenario design, and rule-based question generation. Overall, there are 1100 social contexts and 78100 questions about characters' mental states. The quality of the benchmark is manually verified. Additionally, we evaluate ten popular LLMs onToMValley.  Experimental results suggest that LLMs' performances are significantly inferior to human levels by 11%. Subsequent investigation indicates that LLMs are ineffective at interpreting alterations in mental states across social scenarios. Furthermore, we observe that LLMs are incapable of addressing compositional questions that necessitate multi-hop reasoning within the social context."

        "abstract": "To achieve realistic immersion in landscape images, fluids such as water and clouds need to move within the image while revealing new scenes from various camera perspectives. Recently, a field called dynamic scene video has emerged, which combines single image animation with 3D photography. These methods use pseudo 3D space, implicitly represented with Layered Depth Images (LDIs). LDIs separate a single image into depth-based layers, which enables elements like water and clouds to move within the image while revealing new scenes from different camera perspectives. However, as landscapes typically consist of continuous elements, including fluids, the representation of a 3D space  separates a landscape image into discrete layers, and it can lead to diminished depth perception and potential distortions depending on camera movement. Furthermore, due to its implicit modeling of 3D space, the output may be limited to videos in the 2D domain, potentially reducing their versatility. In this paper, we propose representing a complete 3D space for dynamic scene video by modeling explicit representations, specifically 4D Gaussians, from a single image. The framework is focused on optimizing 3D Gaussians by generating multi-view images from a single image and creating 3D motion to optimize 4D Gaussians. The most important part of proposed framework is consistent 3D motion estimation, which estimates common motion among multi-view images to bring the motion in 3D space closer to actual motions. As far as we know, this is the first attempt that considers animation while representing a complete 3D space from a single landscape image. Our model demonstrates the ability to provide realistic immersion in various landscape images through diverse experiments and metrics.

A plethora of papers and benchmarks have been introduced to evaluate if current models have been able to develop this key ability of social intelligence. However, all rely on limited datasets with simple patterns that can potentially lead to problematic blind spots in evaluation and an overestimation of model capabilities. We introduce TrackTheMind, the first framework to allow large-scale generation of diverse and challenging theory of mind data for robust training and evaluation. Our approach leverages an A* search over a custom domain-specific language to produce complex story structures and novel, diverse, yet plausible scenarios to stress test the limits of LLMs. Our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama-3.1-70B and GPT-4o, show accuracies as low as 5% on TrackTheMind-generated data, highlighting the need for more robust theory of mind evaluation. As our generations are a conceptual superset of prior work, fine-tuning on our data yields a 26-point accuracy improvement on the classic ToMi benchmark (Le et al., 2019). TrackTheMind also enables uncovering underlying skills and factors missing for models to show theory of mind, such as unreliable state tracking or data imbalances, which may contribute to models' poor performance on benchmarks."

        "abstract": "Machine unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of a subset of training samples (i.e., unlearning samples) from a trained model. Effectively and efficiently removing the unlearning samples without negatively impacting the overall model performance is challenging. Existing works mainly exploit input and output space and classification loss, which can result in ineffective unlearning or performance loss. In addition, they utilize on unlearning or remaining samples ineffectively, sacrificing either unlearning efficacy or efficiency. Our main insight is that direct optimization on the representation space utilizing both unlearning and remaining samples can effectively remove influence of unlearning samples while maintaining representations learned from remaining samples. We propose a contrastive unlearning framework, leveraging the concept of representation learning for more effective unlearning. It removes the influence of unlearning samples by contrasting their embeddings against the remaining samples' embeddings so that their embeddings are closer to the embeddings of unseen samples. Experiments on a variety of datasets and models on both class unlearning and sample unlearning showed that contrastive unlearning achieves the best unlearning effects and efficiency with the lowest performance loss compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms."

        "abstract": "When making predictions, a language model must trade off how much it relies on its context vs. its prior knowledge. Choosing how sensitive the model is to its context is a fundamental functionality, as it enables them to excel at tasks like retrieval-augmented generation and question-answering.  In this paper, we search for a knob which controls this sensitivity, determining whether these models answer from the context or its prior knowledge. To guide this search, we design a task for controllable context sensitivity. In this task, we first feed the model a context (\"Paris is in England.\") and a question (\"Where is Paris?\"); we then instruct the model to either use its prior or contextual knowledge and evaluate whether it generates the correct answer for both intents (either England or France). When fine-tuned on this task, instruction-tuned versions of Llama-3.1, Mistral-v0.3, and Gemma-2 can solve it with high accuracy (85-95%). Analyzing these high-performing models, we narrow down which layers may be important to context sensitivity using a novel linear time algorithm. Then, in each model, we identify a 1-D subspace in a single layer that encodes whether the model follows context or prior knowledge. Interestingly, while we identify this subspace in a fine-tuned model, we find that setting its value serves as an effective knob in not only that model but also non-fine-tuned instruct and base models of that model family. Finally, we show a strong correlation between a model's performance and how distinctly it separates context-agreeing from context-ignoring answers in this subspace. These results suggest a single subspace facilitates how the model chooses between context and prior knowledge, hinting at a simple fundamental mechanism that controls this behavior."

        "keywords": "KV Cache Compression, Progressive Compression Strategy",
        "abstract": "The Key-Value (KV) cache is a crucial component in serving transformer-based autoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling faster inference by storing previously computed KV vectors. However, its memory consumption scales linearly with sequence length and batch size, posing a significant bottleneck in LLM deployment. Existing approaches to mitigate this issue include: (1) efficient attention variants integrated in upcycling stages, which requires extensive parameter tuning thus unsuitable to pre-trained LLMs; (2) KV cache compression at test time, primarily through token eviction policies, which often overlook inter-layer dependencies and can be task-specific.This paper introduces an orthogonal approach to KV cache compression. We propose a low-rank approximation of  KV weight matrices, allowing for plug-in integration with existing transformer-based LLMs without model retraining. To effectively compress KV cache at the weight level, we adjust for layerwise sensitivity and introduce a progressive compression strategy, which is supported by our theoretical analysis on how compression errors accumulate in deep networks. Our method is designed to function without model tuning in upcycling stages or task-specific profiling in test stages. Extensive experiments with LLaMA models ranging from 8B to 70B parameters across various tasks show that our approach significantly reduces the GPU memory footprint while maintaining performance."

        "abstract": "Generating diverse responses from large language models (LLMs) is crucial for applications such as planning/search and synthetic data generation, where diversity provides distinct answers across generations.\nPrior approaches rely on increasing temperature to increase diversity. However, contrary to popular belief, we show not only does this approach produce lower quality individual generations as temperature increases, but it depends on model's next-token probabilities being similar to the true distribution of answers. We propose SimpleStrat, an alternative approach that uses the language model itself to partition the space into strata. At inference, a random stratum is selected and a sample drawn from within the strata.\nTo measure diversity, we introduce CoverageQA, a dataset of underspecified questions with multiple equally plausible answers, and assess diversity by measuring KL Divergence between the sampling distribution and uniform distribution over valid ground truth answers. As computing a posterior probability for proprietary models is infeasible, we measure recall on ground truth solutions.\nOur evaluation show using SimpleStrat achieves higher recall by 0.05 compared to GPT-4o and 0.36 average reduction in KL Divergence compared to Llama 3."

        "abstract": "Diffusion probabilistic models learn to remove noise that is artificially added to the data during training. Novel data, like images, may then be generated from Gaussian noise through a sequence of de-noising operations. While this Markov process implicitly defines a joint distribution over noise-free images, it is not simple to condition the generative process on masked observations of partial images. A number of heuristic sampling procedures have been proposed for solving inverse problems with diffusion priors, but these approaches do not directly approximate the true conditional distribution imposed by inference queries, and are often ineffective for high distortion levels and large image masks. Moreover, many of these baselines cannot be applied to latent diffusion models which use image encodings for efficiency. We instead develop a hierarchical variational inference algorithm that analytically marginalizes missing features, and uses a rigorous variational bound to optimize a non-Gaussian Markov approximation of the true diffusion posterior. Through extensive experiments with both pixel-based and latent diffusion models of images, we show that our VIPaint method significantly outperforms previous approaches in both the plausibility and diversity of imputations, and is easily generalized to other inverse problems like deblurring and superresolution."
