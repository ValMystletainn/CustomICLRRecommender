        "abstract": "We investigate the look-ahead capabilities of chess-playing neural networks, specifically focusing on the Leela Chess Zero policy network. We build on the work of Jenner et al. by analyzing the model's ability to consider future moves and alternative sequences beyond the immediate next move. Our findings reveal that the network's look-ahead behavior is highly context-dependent, varying significantly based on the specific chess position. We demonstrate that the model can process information about board states up to seven moves ahead, utilizing similar internal mechanisms across different future time steps. Additionally, we provide evidence that the network considers multiple possible move sequences rather than focusing on a single line of play. These results offer new insights into the emergence of sophisticated look-ahead capabilities in neural networks trained on strategic tasks, contributing to our understanding of AI reasoning in complex domains. Our work also showcases the effectiveness of interpretability techniques in uncovering cognitive-like processes in artificial intelligence systems."

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) often relies on trial and error, which may cause undesirable outcomes. As a result, standard RL is inappropriate for safety-critical applications. To address this issue, one may train a safe agent in a controlled environment (where safety violations are allowed) and then transfer it to the real world (where safety violations may have disastrous consequences). Prior work has made this transfer safe as long as the new environment preserves the safety-related dynamics. However, in most practical applications, differences or shifts in dynamics between the two environments are inevitable, potentially leading to safety violations after the transfer. This work aims to guarantee safety even when the new environment has different (safety-related) dynamics. In other words, we aim to make the process of safe transfer robust. Our methodology (1) robustifies an agent in the controlled environment and (2) provably provides---under mild assumption---a safe transfer to new environments. The empirical evaluation shows that this method yields policies that are robust against changes in dynamics, demonstrating safety after transfer to a new environment."

Drawing inspiration from this efficiency, we introduce the $\\textit{Foveated Dynamic Vision Transformer (FDT)}$, a novel architecture that integrates these mechanisms into a vision transformer framework. Unlike existing models, the FDT uses a single-pass strategy, utilizing fixation and foveation modules to enhance computational efficiency and accuracy. The fixation module identifies fixation points to filter out irrelevant information, while the foveation module generates foveated embeddings with multi-scale information. Our findings show that the FDT achieves superior accuracy and computational efficiency, with a 34% reduction in multiply-accumulate operations. Additionally, the FDT exhibits robustness against various types of noise and adversarial attacks without specific training for these challenges. These attributes make the FDT a significant step forward in creating artificial neural networks that mirror the efficiency, robustness, and adaptability of the HVS."

In particular, we ask (1) when two languages employ the same morphosyntactic processes, do LLMs handle them using shared internal circuitry? and (2) when two languages require different morphosyntactic processes, do LLMs handle them using different internal circuitry? Using English and Chinese multilingual and monolingual models, we analyze the internal circuitry involved in two tasks. We find evidence that models employ the same circuit to handle the same syntactic process independently of the language in which it occurs, and that this is the case even for monolingual models trained completely independently. Moreover, we show that multilingual models employ language-specific components (attention heads and MLPs) when needed to handle linguistic processes (e.g., morphological marking) that only exist in some languages. Together, our results provide new insights into how LLMs trade off between exploiting common structures and preserving linguistic differences when tasked with modeling multiple languages simultaneously."

While RNNs are easily trained to perform a wide range of tasks, the nature and extent of the degeneracy in the resultant solutions (i.e., the variability across trained RNNs) remain poorly understood. Here, we provide a unified framework for analyzing degeneracy across three levels: behavior, neural dynamics, and weight space. We analyzed RNNs trained on diverse tasks across machine learning and neuroscience domains, including N-bit flip-flop, sine wave generation, delayed discrimination, and path integration. \nOur key finding is that the variability across RNN solutions, quantified on the basis of neural dynamics and trained weights, depends primarily on network capacity and task characteristics such as complexity. We introduce information-theoretic measures to quantify task complexity and demonstrate that increasing task complexity consistently reduces degeneracy in neural dynamics and generalization behavior while increasing degeneracy in weight space. These relationships hold across diverse tasks and can be used to control the degeneracy of the solution space of task-trained RNNs. Furthermore, we provide several strategies to control solution degeneracy, enabling task-trained RNNs to learn more consistent or diverse solutions as needed. We envision that these insights will lead to more reliable machine learning models and could inspire strategies to better understand and control degeneracy observed in neuroscience experiments."

        "abstract": "AI image compression has outperformed traditional methods in both efficiency and quality but remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Most attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs) involve adding small perturbations to the input image to deceive the system and produce incorrect results. While simple, these additive perturbations affect pixels uniformly across different intensity levels, from dark to bright regions. However the human eye is less sensitive to variations in dark areas than in bright ones, making noise in brighter areas more visible. This observation suggests a novel attack strategy that minimizes the visibility of adversarial noise through adaptive perturbations. To achieve this, we propose a nonlinear log-exp perturbation, which applies more noise to dark pixels while minimizing its impact on bright areas.We evaluated this perturbation model in two scenarios: one  distorts the output of decompression models and another one increases the bit rate of compressed images without visibly affecting quality. Our findings offer new strategies to protect AI-driven image compression systems, ensuring both security and performance in practical applications."

A closed-form solution is provided for the optimization problem, which can be computed efficiently. Several important practical issues are also tackled: 1) The combination of the optimized distribution and the vocabulary truncating technique is considered, 2) An often-overlooked tokenization mismatch issue is resolved with a simple prompt selection approach, and 3) The combination of the optimized distribution with other sequence-level selection heuristics to further enhance the efficiency and reliability is studied."

In this paper, we use a family of tractable probabilistic models called probabilistic circuits (PCs), which can be equipped to a pre-trained generative model to produce fair images without fine-tuning. We show that for a given trained generative model, our method only requires a small fair reference dataset to train the PC, removing the need to retrain the generative model on a large dataset. Our experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a balance between training resources and ensuring fairness and quality of generated images."

        "abstract": "We introduce the novel problem of remote reinforcement learning (RRL) with a communication constraint, in which the actor that takes the actions in the environment lacks direct access to the reward signal. Instead, the rewards are observed by a controller, which communicates with the agent through a communication-constrained channel. This can model a remote control scenario over a wireless channel, where the communication link from the controller to the agent has limited capacity due to power, bandwidth, or delay constraints. In the proposed solution, rather than transmitting the reward values to the agent over the rate-limited channel, the controller learns the optimal policy, and at each round, signals the action that the agent should take over the channel. However, instead of sending the precise action--which can be prohibitive when the action set is large--we use an importance sampling approach to reduce the communication load, which allows the agent to sample an action from the current policy. The actor, sampling from the desired policy at each turn, can also learn the optimal policy, albeit at a slower pace, using supervised learning. We exploit the learned policy at the actor to further reduce the communication load. Our solution, called Guided Remote Action Sampling Policy (GRASP), exhibits a significant reduction in communication requirements, achieving an average of 12-fold decrease in data transmission across all experiments, and 50-fold reduction for environments with continuous action spaces. We also show the applicability of GRASP beyond single-agent scenarios, including parallel and multi-agent environments."

Disentangled representations serve as world models, isolating latent factors of variation in the world along approximately orthogonal directions, thus facilitating feature-based generalization. We provide experimental and theoretical results guaranteeing the emergence of disentangled representations in agents that optimally solve multi-task evidence aggregation classification tasks, canonical in the cognitive neuroscience literature. The key conceptual finding is that, by producing accurate multi-task classification estimates, a system implicitly represents a set of coordinates specifying a disentangled representation of the underlying latent state of the data it receives. The theory provides conditions for the emergence of these representations in terms of noise, number of tasks, and evidence aggregation time. Surprisingly, the theory also produces closed-form expressions for extracting the disentangled representation from the model's latent state $\\mathbf Z(t)$. We experimentally validate these predictions in RNNs trained on multi-task classification, which learn disentangled representations in the form of continuous attractors, leading to zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in predicting latent factors. We demonstrate the robustness of our framework across autoregressive architectures, decision boundary geometries and in tasks requiring classification confidence estimation. We find that transformers are particularly suited for disentangling representations, which might explain their unique world understanding abilities. Overall, our framework puts forth parallel processing as a general principle for the formation of cognitive maps that capture the structure of the world in both biological and artificial systems, and helps explain why ANNs often arrive at human-interpretable concepts, and how they both may acquire exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities."

Despite the superior performance, the theoretical understanding of this line of methods is still preliminary, leaving space for algorithm improvement. Moreover, existing methods predominately focus on Euclidean data manifold, and there is a compelling need for guided flow methods on complex geometries such as SO(3), which prevails in high-stake scientific applications like protein design. We present OC-Flow, a general and theoretically grounded training-free framework for guided flow matching using optimal control. Building upon advances in optimal control theory, we develop effective and practical algorithms for solving optimal control in guided ODE-based generation and provide a systematic theoretical analysis of the convergence guarantee in both Euclidean and SO(3).

We propose to address this issue via two key components: a technique to factor next-token prediction through intermediate CoT text, ensuring the CoT is causally load-bearing, and a reinforcement learning approach to train CoT to predict future tokens independently of other context. This results in \"Markovian\" language models, where CoT serves as a fixed-size state for future token prediction. Our approach optimizes for \"informativeness\" – the improvement in next-token predictions using a trained CoT compared to a baseline. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) on arithmetic problems and achieve an 11% performance boost on the GSM8K benchmark using Mistral 7B Inst V2. The increased sensitivity of model performance to CoT perturbations provides strong evidence of CoT reliance.

        "abstract": "Sparse Principal Component Analysis (Sparse PCA) is a pivotal tool in data analysis and dimensionality reduction. However, Sparse PCA is a challenging problem in both theory and practice: it is known to be NP-hard and current exact methods generally require exponential runtime. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to efficiently approximate Sparse PCA by (i) approximating the  general input covariance matrix with a re-sorted block-diagonal matrix, (ii) solving the Sparse PCA sub-problem in each block, and (iii) reconstructing the solution to the original problem. Our framework is simple and powerful: it can leverage any off-the-shelf Sparse PCA algorithm and achieve significant computational speedups, with a minor additive error that is linear in the approximation error of the block-diagonal matrix. Suppose $g(k, d)$ is the runtime of an algorithm (approximately) solving Sparse PCA in dimension $d$ and with sparsity value $k$. Our framework, when integrated with this algorithm, reduces the runtime to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{d}{d^\\star} \\cdot g(k, d^\\star) + d^2\\right)$, where $d^\\star \\leq d$ is the largest block size of the block-diagonal matrix. For instance, integrating our framework with the Branch-and-Bound algorithm reduces the complexity from $g(k, d) = \\mathcal{O}(k^3\\cdot d^k)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(k^3\\cdot d \\cdot (d^\\star)^{k-1})$, demonstrating exponential speedups if $d^\\star$ is small. We perform large-scale evaluations on many real-world datasets: for exact Sparse PCA algorithm, our method achieves an average speedup factor of 93.77, while maintaining an average approximation error of 2.15%; for approximate Sparse PCA algorithm, our method achieves an average speedup factor of 6.77 and an average approximation error of merely 0.37%."

        "abstract": "With the increasing ubiquity of large language models it has become crucial to ensure guarantees for models trained to be aligned with human values to avoid leaking information on the human judgements that have been provided to the algorithm. To target this issue we focus on the problem of alignment via reinforcement learning from human preference rankings, subject to the constraint of \nnot revealing any information on the human data used to align the model. To achieve this, we analyze $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP for both the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model and the Plackett-Luce (PL) model. We introduce a theoretically founded algorithm for learning rewards from human rankings that achieves this objective without leaking the human rankings. We further demonstrate that the privately learned rewards can be used to train policies achieving statistical performance guarantees that asymptotically match the best known algorithms in the non-private setting, which are in some cases minimax optimal. Strikingly, our analysis and our results reveal that it is possible to obtain the same model performance without any trade-off on the protection of the human judgments, and our paper provides the first algorithms that can achieve provable privacy of human judgements, while still producing aligned models with optimal performance."

        "abstract": "Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often solved by Branch and bound (B&B). A key factor influencing the performance of B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions. Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce B&B MDPs, a principled vanilla MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B&B heuristics. Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP benchmarks."

        "abstract": "We propose Word-Frequency-based Image-Text Pair Pruning (WFPP), a novel data pruning method that improves the efficiency of VLMs.\nUnlike MetaCLIP, our method does not need metadata for pruning, but selects text-image pairs to prune based on the content of the text. Specifically, WFPP prunes text-image pairs containing high-frequency words across the entire training dataset. The effect of WFPP is to reduce the dominance of frequent words. The result a better balanced word-frequency distribution in the dataset, which is known to improve the training of word embedding models. After pre-training on the pruned subset, we fine-tuned the model on the entire dataset for one additional epoch to achieve better performance. Our experiments demonstrate that applying WFPP when training a CLIP model improves performance on a wide range of downstream tasks. WFPP also provides the advantage of speeding up pre-training by using fewer samples. Additionally, we analyze the training data before and after pruning to visualize how WFPP changes the balance of word frequencies. We hope our work encourages researchers to consider the distribution of words in the training data when pre-training VLMs, not limited to CLIP."

        "abstract": "Visual prompt-based large vision models exhibit remarkable performance in a range of vision tasks. However, visual prompting large vision models are computationally intensive and resource-demanding due to their large parameter sizes and the complexity of processing visual prompts, resulting in inefficiencies in speed and memory usage. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Efficient Painter model, which leverages a novel context-aggregated attention based trident block to alleviate cross-task gaps and reduce memory and computation overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-blocks feature union module to capture global contextual information at different levels and speed up training. This architecture mitigates training costs and memory requirements during inference. Our model strikes a balance between speed and memory efficiency, achieving a 19$\\times$ reduction in FLOPs. Moreover, our model is 9$\\times$ smaller in model size and runs 4.1$\\times$ and 27$\\times$ faster during training and inference, respectively. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our design effectively processes additional visual prompts and outperforms baseline methods on standard benchmarks like \\textit{SIDD} and \\textit{LoL} in zero-shot settings, improving performance by 0.4% and 1.2% respectively."

        "abstract": "Neural Networks (NN) with ReLU activation functions have been used as surrogate models for multiparametric quadratic problems (mp-QP) for a wide range of engineering applications. Researchers have suggested leveraging the piecewise affine property of deep NN models to solve mp-QP with linear constraints, which also exhibit piecewise affine behaviour. However, traditional deep NN applications to mp-QP fall short of providing optimal and feasible predictions, even when trained with large datasets. This study introduces a semi-supervised NN (SSNN) architecture that directly represents the mathematical structure of the global solution function. In contrast to generic NN training approaches, the proposed SSNN method derives a large proportion of model weights directly from the physical characteristics of the system, producing solutions with higher accuracy despite training on significantly smaller data sets.  Since many energy management problems are formulated as QP, the proposed approach has been applied in energy systems to demonstrate proof of concept. Model performance in terms of solution accuracy and speed of the predictions was compared against a commercial solver and a generic NN model based on classical training. Results show KKT sufficient conditions for SSNN consistently outperform generic NN architectures with classical training using far less data. A similar performance advantage is shown using extreme, out-of-training distribution test data. Given its advantages of speed and reliability, the SSNN model can quickly produce optimal and feasible solutions within a second for millions of input parameters sampled from a distribution of stochastic demands and renewable generator dispatches, which can be used for simulations and long term planning."
