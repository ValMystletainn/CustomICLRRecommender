        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes a pretrained large language model (LLM) using user preference data, enabling it to generate content aligned with human preferences. However, due to privacy concerns, users may be reluctant to share sensitive preference data. To address this, we propose utilizing Federated Learning (FL) techniques, allowing large-scale preference collection from diverse real-world users without requiring them to transmit data to a central server. Our federated RLHF methods (i.e., FedBis and FedBiscuit) encode each clientâ€™s preferences into binary selectors and aggregate them to capture common preferences. In particular, FedBiscuit overcomes key challenges, such as preference heterogeneity and reward hacking, through innovative solutions like grouping clients with similar preferences to reduce heterogeneity and using multiple binary selectors to enhance LLM output quality. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we establish the first federated RLHF benchmark with a heterogeneous human preference dataset. Experimental results show that by integrating the LLM with aggregated client preferences, FedBis and FedBiscuit significantly enhance the professionalism and readability of the generated content."

        "abstract": "While graph neural networks have demonstrated potential across various applications, explaining their predictions on dynamic graphs remains largely under-explored. This paper introduces a new research task: self-interpretable GNNs for continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDGs). We aim to predict future links within dynamic graphs while simultaneously providing causal explanations for these predictions. There are two key challenges: (1) capturing the underlying structural and temporal information that remains consistent across both independent and identically distributed (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and (2) efficiently generating high-quality link prediction results and explanations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel causal inference model, namely the Independent and Confounded Causal Model (ICCM).  ICCM is then integrated into a deep learning architecture that considers both effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing methods across link prediction accuracy, explanation quality, and robustness to OOD data.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is rapidly reaching and surpassing human-level control capabilities. However, state-of-the-art RL algorithms often require timesteps and reaction times significantly faster than human capabilities, which is impractical in real-world settings and typically necessitates specialized hardware. Such speeds are difficult to achieve in the real world and often requires specialized hardware. We introduce Sequence Reinforcement Learning (SRL), an RL algorithm designed to produce a sequence of actions for a given input state, enabling effective control at lower decision frequencies. SRL addresses the challenges of learning action sequences by employing both a model and an actor-critic architecture operating at different temporal scales. We propose a \"temporal recall\" mechanism, where the critic uses the model to estimate intermediate states between primitive actions, providing a learning signal for each individual action within the sequence. Once training is complete, the actor can generate action sequences independently of the model, achieving model-free control at a slower frequency. We evaluate SRL on a suite of continuous control tasks, demonstrating that it achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms while significantly reducing actor sample complexity. To better assess performance across varying decision frequencies, we introduce the Frequency-Averaged Score (FAS) metric. Our results show that SRL significantly outperforms traditional RL algorithms in terms of FAS, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring variable decision frequencies. Additionally, we compare SRL with model-based online planning, showing that SRL achieves superior FAS while leveraging the same model during training that online planners use for planning. Lastly, we highlight the biological relevance of SRL, showing that it replicates the \"action chunking\" behavior observed in the basal ganglia, offering insights into brain-inspired control mechanisms."

Choice models have been widely applied across various domainsâ€”such as commercial demand forecasting, recommendation systems, and consumer behavior analysisâ€”typically categorized as parametric, nonparametric, or deep network-based. While recent innovations have favored neural network approaches for their computational power, these flexible models often involve large parameter sets and lack interpretability, limiting their effectiveness in contexts where transparency is essential.Previous empirical evidence shows that individuals usually use {\\it heuristic decision rules} to form their consideration sets, from which they then choose. These rules are often represented as {\\it disjunctions of conjunctions} (i.e., OR-of-ANDs). These rules-driven, {\\it consider-then-choose} decision processes enable people to quickly screen numerous alternatives while reducing cognitive and search costs. Motivated by this insight, our approach leverages logic rules to elucidate human choices, providing a fresh perspective on preference modeling. We introduce a unique combination of column generation techniques and the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to facilitate efficient rule extraction for preference modelingâ€”a process recognized as NP-hard. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on both synthetic datasets and real-world data from commercial and healthcare domains, demonstrates that Logic-Logit significantly outperforms baseline models in terms of interpretability and accuracy."

However, pursuing adversarial robustness from the network architecture perspective demands tremendous computational resources, thereby hampering progress in understanding and designing robust architectures. In this work, we aim to lower this barrier-to-entry for researchers without access to large-scale computation by introducing the first comprehensive neural architecture dataset under adversarial training, dubbed NARes, for adversarial robustness. NARes comprises 15,625 WRN-style unique architectures adversarially trained and evaluated against four adversarial attacks (including AutoAttack). With NARes, researchers can query the adversarial robustness of various models immediately, along with more detailed information, such as fine-grained training statistics, empirical Lipschitz constant, stable accuracy, etc. In addition, four checkpoints are provided for each architecture to facilitate further fine-tuning or analysis. For the first time, the dataset provides a high-resolution architecture landscape for adversarial robustness, enabling quick verifications of theoretical or empirical ideas. Through NARes, we offered some new insight and identified some contradictions in statements of prior studies. We believe NARes can serve as a valuable resource for the community to advance the understanding and design of robust neural architectures."

We introduce a family of synthetic CFGs that produce hierarchical rules, capable of generating lengthy sentences (e.g., hundreds of tokens) that are locally ambiguous and require dynamic programming to parse. Despite this complexity, we demonstrate that generative models like GPT can accurately learn this CFG language and generate sentences based on it. We explore the model's internals, revealing that its hidden states precisely capture the structure of CFGs, and its attention patterns resemble the information passing in a dynamic programming algorithm."

In this paper, we introduce a versatile encoder-decoder model designed to infer  evolving mental processes based on irregularly observed action events and predict future occurrences. The primary challenges arise from two factors: both actions and mental processes are irregular events, and the observed action data is often limited. To address the irregularity of these events, we leverage a temporal point process model within the encoder-decoder framework, effectively capturing the dynamics of both action and mental events. Additionally, we implement a backtracking mechanism in the decoder to enhance the accuracy of predicting future actions and evolving mental states. To tackle the issue of limited data, our model incorporates logic rules as priors, enabling accurate inferences from just a few observed samples. These logic rules can be refined and updated as needed, providing flexibility to the model. Overall, our approach enhances the understanding of human behavior by predicting when actions will occur and how mental processes evolve. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the strong performance of our model in inferring mental states and predicting future actions, contributing to the development of more human-centric AI systems."

We show theoretically that ReLU networks that learn low-dimensional feature representations have a lower local complexity. This allows us to connect recent empirical observations on feature learning at the level of the weight matrices with concrete properties of the learned functions. In particular, we show that the local complexity serves as an upper bound on the total variation of the function over the input data distribution and thus that feature learning can be related to adversarial robustness. Lastly, we consider how optimization drives ReLU networks towards solutions with lower local complexity. Overall, this work contributes a theoretical framework towards relating geometric properties of ReLU networks to different aspects of learning such as feature learning and representation cost."

        "abstract": "Given a task in the form of a basic description and its training examples, prompt optimization is the problem of synthesizing the given information into a text prompt for a large language model. Humans solve this problem by also considering the different facets that define a task (e.g., counter-examples, explanations, analogies) and including them in the prompt. However, it is unclear whether existing algorithmic approaches, based on iteratively editing a given prompt or automatically selecting a few in-context examples, can cover the multiple facets required to solve a complex task.  In this work, we view prompt optimization as that of learning multiple facets of a task from a set of training examples. We exploit structure in the prompt optimization problem and break down a prompt into loosely coupled semantic sections. The proposed algorithm, UniPrompt, (1) clusters the input space and uses clustered batches so that each batch likely corresponds to a different facet of the task, and (2) utilizes a feedback mechanism to propose adding, editing or deleting a section, which in turn is aggregated over a batch to capture generalizable facets. Empirical evaluation on multiple datasets and a real-world task shows that prompts generated using UniPrompt obtain higher accuracy than human-tuned prompts and those from state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our algorithm can generate long, complex prompts that existing methods are unable to generate."

Existing studies have developed LLM-based guard models designed to moderate the input and output of threat LLMs, ensuring adherence to safety policies by blocking content that violates these protocols upon deployment. However, limited attention has been given to the reliability and calibration of such guard models. In this work, we empirically conduct comprehensive investigations of confidence calibration for 9 existing LLM-based guard models on 12 benchmarks in both user input and model output classification. Our findings reveal that current LLM-based guard models tend to 1) produce overconfident predictions, 2) exhibit significant miscalibration when subjected to jailbreak attacks, and 3) demonstrate limited robustness to the outputs generated by different types of response models. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of post-hoc calibration methods to mitigate miscalibration. We demonstrate the efficacy of temperature scaling and, for the first time, highlight the benefits of contextual calibration for confidence calibration of guard models, particularly in the absence of validation sets. Our analysis and experiments underscore the limitations of current LLM-based guard models and provide valuable insights for the future development of well-calibrated guard models toward more reliable content moderation.

However, analyzing these deterministic samplers presents unique challenges, as they preclude the use of established techniques such as Girsanov's theorem, which are only applicable to stochastic samplers. Furthermore, existing analysis for deterministic samplers usually focuses on some specific examples, lacking a generalized approach for general forward processes and various deterministic samplers. Our paper addresses these limitations by introducing a unified convergence analysis framework. To demonstrate the power of our framework, we analyze the variance-preserving (VP) forward process with the exponential integrator (EI) scheme, and achieved iteration complexity of $\\tilde{O}(d^2/\\epsilon)$.

Recent advancements in hardware have significantly reduced matrix multiplication times, making neural network simulation both fast and efficient. Consequently, functions defined by complex Boolean networks are increasingly viable candidates for simulation through their neural network representation. Prior research has introduced a general method for deriving neural network representations of Boolean networks. However, the resulting neural networks are often suboptimal in terms of the number of neurons and connections, leading to slower simulation performance. Optimizing them while preserving functional equivalence --lossless optimization-- is an NP-hard problem, and current methods only provide lossy solutions. In this paper, we present an algorithm to optimize such neural networks in terms of neurons and connections while preserving functional equivalence. Moreover, to accelerate the compression of the neural network, we introduce an objective-aware algorithm that exploits representations that are shared among subproblems of the overall optimization. We demonstrate experimentally that we are able to reduce connections and neurons by up to 70% and 60%, respectively, in comparison to state-of-the-art. We also find that our objective-aware algorithm results in consistent speedups in optimization time, achieving up to 34.3x and 5.9x speedup relative to naive and caching solutions, respectively.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been used as experts to infer causal graphs, often by repeatedly applying a pairwise prompt that asks about the causal relationship of each variable pair. However, such experts, including human domain experts, cannot distinguish between direct and indirect effects given a pairwise prompt. Therefore, instead of the graph, we propose that causal order be used as a more stable output interface for utilizing expert knowledge. When querying a perfect expert with a pairwise prompt, we show that the inferred graph can have significant errors whereas the causal order is always correct. In practice, however, LLMs are imperfect experts and we find that pairwise prompts lead to multiple cycles and do not yield a valid order. Hence, we propose a prompting strategy that introduces an auxiliary variable for every variable pair and instructs the LLM to avoid cycles within this triplet. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that such a triplet prompt leads to fewer cycles than the pairwise prompt. Across multiple real-world graphs, the triplet prompt yields a more accurate order using both LLMs and human annotators as experts. By querying the expert with different auxiliary variables for the same variable pair, it also increases robustness---triplet method with much smaller models such as Phi-3 and Llama-3 8B outperforms a pairwise prompt with GPT-4. For practical usage, we show how the estimated causal order from the triplet method  can be used to reduce error in downstream discovery and effect inference tasks."

        "abstract": "Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in solving reasoning tasks; however, even the strongest models still occasionally make reasoning mistakes. Recently, there has been active research aimed at improving reasoning accuracy, particularly by using pretrained language models to \"self-correct'' their mistakes via multi-round prompting. In this paper, we follow this line of work but focus on understanding the usefulness of incorporating ``error-correction'' data directly into the pretraining stage. This data consists of erroneous solution steps immediately followed by their corrections. Using a synthetic math dataset, we show promising results: this type of pretrain data can help language models achieve higher reasoning accuracy directly (i.e., through simple auto-regression, without multi-round prompting) compared to pretraining on the same amount of error-free data. We also delve into many details, such as (1) how this approach differs from beam search, (2) how such data can be prepared, (3) whether masking is needed on the erroneous tokens, (4) the amount of error required, (5) whether such data can be deferred to the fine-tuning stage, and many others."

        "abstract": "Molecular property prediction is vital in drug discovery and cheminformatics, yet many current models lack interpretability, making it difficult for experts to understand the rationale behind predictions. To address this, we introduce ChemThinker, a novel large language models (LLMs) multi-agent framework designed to effectively control the internal representations of concepts and functions within LLMs. ChemThinker emulates the way chemists approach molecular analysis by integrating insights from three perspectives: general molecular properties, data-driven analysis, and task-specific factors. Each perspective uses an agentic approach to stimulate the LLM's internal representations, enabling more targeted and interpretable outputs based on the problem at hand, akin to how stimuli trigger the brain's cognitive processes. By feeding representations from these three perspectives into a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP), ChemThinker achieves superior performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework provides interpretable insights into the molecular mechanisms driving the predictions, making it a practical tool for drug discovery and other cheminformatics applications."

        "keywords": "Knowledge distillation; Computer vision; Contrastive learning.",
        "abstract": "Since the advent of knowledge distillation, much research has focused on how the soft labels generated by the teacher model can be utilized effectively. A study points out that the implicit knowledge within soft labels originates from the multi-view structure present in the data. Feature variations within samples of the same class allow the student model to generalize better by learning diverse representations. However, in existing distillation methods, teacher models predominantly adhere to ground-truth labels as targets, without considering the diverse representations within the same class. Therefore, we propose incorporating an intra-class contrastive loss during teacher training to enrich the intra-class information contained in soft labels. In practice, we find that intra-class loss causes instability in training and slows convergence. To mitigate these issues, margin loss is integrated into intra-class contrastive learning to improve the training stability and convergence speed. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the impact of this loss on the intra-class distances and inter-class distances. It has been proved that the intra-class contrastive loss can enrich the intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

        "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to improve (upcycle) an existing large language model without the prohibitive requirements of continued pre-training of the full-model. The idea is to split the pre-training data into semantically relevant groups and train an expert on each subset. An expert takes the form of a lightweight adapter added on the top of a frozen base model. During inference, an incoming query is first routed to the most relevant expert which is then loaded onto the base model for the forward pass. Unlike typical Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, the experts in our method do not work with other experts for a single query. Hence, we dub them ``introvert'' experts. Freezing the base model and keeping the experts as lightweight adapters allows extreme parallelism during training and inference. Training of all experts can be done in parallel without any communication channels between them. Similarly, the inference can also be heavily parallelized by distributing experts on different GPUs and routing each request to the GPU containing its relevant expert. We implement a proof-of-concept version of this method and show the validity of our approach."

        "abstract": "Program induction is a typical approach that helps Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex knowledge-intensive question answering over knowledge bases (KBs) to alleviate the hallucination of LLMs. However, the accurate program induction usually requires a large number of high-quality parallel data of a specific KB, which is difficult to acquire for many low-resource KBs. Additionally, due to heterogeneity of questions and KB schemas, the transferability of a model trained on a single dataset is poor. To this end, we propose REPANA, a reasoning path navigated program induction framework that enables LLMs to reason over heterogeneous KBs. We decouple the program generation capability into perceiving the KB and mapping questions to program sketches. Accordingly, our framework consists of two main components. The first is an LLM-based navigator, which retrieves reasoning paths of the input question from the given KB. The second is a KB-agnostic parser trained on data from multiple heterogeneous datasets, taking the navigator's retrieved paths and the question as input and generating the corresponding program. Experiments show that REPANA exhibits strong generalization and transferability. It can directly perform inference on datasets not seen during training, outperforming other SoTA low-resource methods and even approaching the performance of supervised methods."

        "abstract": "Existing approaches leveraging large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP for zero-shot text-image classification often focus on generating fine-grained class-specific descriptors, leaving higher-order semantic relations between classes underutilised.\nWe address this gap by proposing Defined Taxonomic Stratification (DefNTaxS), a novel and malleable framework that supplements per-class descriptors with inter-class taxonomies to enrich semantic resolution in zero-shot classification tasks.\nUsing large language models (LLMs), DefNTaxS automatically generates subcategories that group similar classes and appends context-specific prompt elements for each dataset/subcategory, reducing inter-class competition and providing deeper semantic insight.\nThis process is fully automated, requiring no manual modifications or further training for any of the models involved.\nWe demonstrate that DefNTaxS yields consistent performance gains across a number of datasets often used to benchmark frameworks of this type, enhancing accuracy and semantic interpretability in zero-shot classification tasks of varying scale, granularity, and type."
