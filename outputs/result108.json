        "abstract": "Although the theory of deep neural networks has been studied for years, the mechanism of pooling layers is still elusive. In this paper, we report the angle contraction behavior of pooling strategies (the average pooling and max pooling) at initialization. Compared to the relu-activated fully connected layer or convolutional layer, the pooling layer stands as the main source of contraction of the angle between hidden features. Moreover, we show that the cosine similarity between average pooling features in convolutional neural network is more data-dependent than fully connected network, while the max pooling is not sensitive to the data distribution in both architectures. Our results may complement the understanding of the representation learning."

        "abstract": "Understanding the limitations of neural language models is crucial for knowing what such models are capable of and how they can be used safely. A popular approach to analyzing formal limitations takes the form of training models on formal languages, and studying what aspects of the languages affect model performance. Formal languages can, for instance, be designed using manually constructed grammars or randomly sampled by sampling some type of automata. This provides the researcher with unique control over the features of the language of interest. In this paper, we provide an even more fine-grained approach to targeted model evaluation. We develop a method for controlling specific \\emph{string} features, on the corpus level, in the language of a given automaton. This gives us control over properties such as symbol frequencies while keeping everything else intact, enabling a causal study of their importance. To describe our framework formally, we turn to \\emph{semirings} and introduce finite state automata over a novel---counting---semiring. We devise algorithms that enable string sampling under varying degrees of interventions and demonstrate the utility of our method through several examples showing how targeted interventions over transition, symbol, and state frequencies can be performed. We then train Transformer and LSTM language models on languages under varying degrees of interventions. Our fine-grained analysis allows us to show that different mechanisms influence the learning behavior of these two architectures."

However, existing world models often struggle with irrelevant background information and omit moving tiny objects that can be essential to tasks. To solve this problem, we introduce the Motion-Aware World Model (MAWM), which incorporates a fine-grained motion predictor and entails action-conditional video prediction. The combination yields compact and robust representations of environments, filters out extraneous backgrounds, and keeps track of the pixel-level motion of objects. Moreover, we demonstrate that a world model with action-conditional video prediction can be interpreted as a variational autoencoder (VAE) for the whole video. Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark show that the proposed MAWM outperforms current prevailing MBRL methods. We further show its state-of-the-art performance across challenging tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite."

Numerous studies are dedicated to exploring and expanding the boundaries of this reasoning capability. However, tasks that embody both reasoning and recall characteristics are often overlooked. In this paper, we introduce such a novel task, code reasoning, to provide a new perspective for the reasoning abilities of LLMs.\nWe summarize three meta-benchmarks based on established forms of logical reasoning, and instantiate these into eight specific benchmark tasks. Our testing on these benchmarks reveals that LLMs continue to struggle with identifying satisfactory reasoning pathways.\nAdditionally, we present a new pathway exploration pipeline inspired by human intricate problem-solving methods. This \\textbf{R}eflective Hypothesis Decomposition and Amendment (RHDA) pipeline consists of the following iterative steps: (1) Proposing potential hypotheses based on observations and decomposing them; (2) Utilizing tools to validate hypotheses and reflection outcomes; (3) Revising hypothesis in light of observations. Our approach effectively mitigates logical chain collapses arising from forgetting or hallucination issues in multi-step reasoning, resulting in performance gains of up to $3\\times$. Finally, we expanded this pipeline by applying it to simulate complex household tasks in real-world scenarios, specifically in VirtualHome, enhancing the handling of failure cases.

        "abstract": "Large-scale deep learning models with a pretraining-finetuning paradigm have led to a surge of numerous task-specific models finetuned from a common pretrained model. Recently, several research efforts have been made on merging these large models into a single multi-task model, particularly with simple arithmetic on parameters. Such merging methodology faces a central challenge: interference between model parameters finetuned on different tasks. Few recent works have focused on desiging a new finetuning scheme that can lead to small parameter interference, however at the cost of the performance of each task-specific finetuned model and thereby limiting that of a merged model. To improve the performance of a merged model, we note that a finetuning scheme should aim for (1) smaller parameter interference and (2) better performance of each finetuned model on the corresponding task. In this work, we aim to design a new finetuning objective function to work towards these two goals. In the course of this process, we find such objective function to be strikingly similar to sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) objective function, which aims to achieve generalization by finding flat minima. Drawing upon our observation, we propose to finetune pretrained models via SAM or its variants. The experimental and theoretical results showcase the effectiveness and orthogonality of our proposed approach, improving performance upon various merging and finetuning methods."

In our paper we focus on the agentâ€™s interaction with the environment in a high-dimensional MDP during the learning phase and we introduce a theoretically-founded novel method based on experiences obtained through extremum actions. Our analysis and method provides a theoretical basis for effective, accelerated and efficient experience collection, and further comes with zero additional computational cost while leading to significant acceleration of training in deep reinforcement learning.

Traditionally, this exercise involves careful curation of datasets and repeated fine-tuning of the underlying model. Fine-tuning techniques enable practitioners to adapt foundation models for many new applications but require expensive and lengthy training while being notably sensitive to hyper-parameter choices. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyperLoRA, a model capable of adapting Large Language Models on the fly---solely based on a natural language description of the target task.  HyperLoRA is a hypernetwork trained to construct LoRAs in a single inexpensive forward pass. After training HyperLoRA on a suite of 9 pre-trained LoRA adapters (GSM8K, Arc, etc.), we show that the ad-hoc reconstructed LoRA instances match the performance of task-specific adapters across the corresponding test sets.\nFurthermore, HyperLoRA can compress hundreds of LoRA instances and zero-shot generalize to entirely unseen tasks. This approach provides a significant step towards democratizing the specialization of foundation models and enables language-based adaptation with minimal compute requirements.

However, several researchers have shown that model parameters and gradient information are susceptible to privacy leakage. Although, Differentially Private SGD (DPSGD) addresses privacy concerns, its static noise mechanism impacts the error bounds for model performance. Additionally, with the exponential increase in model parameters, efficient learning of these models using stochastic optimizers has become more challenging. To address these concerns, we introduce the Dynamically Differentially Private Projected Stochastic Gradient Descent (D2P2-SGD) optimizer. In D2P2-SGD, we combine two important ideas: (i) dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with automatic gradient clipping and (ii) random projection with SGD, allowing dynamic adjustment of the tradeoff between utility and privacy of the model. It demonstrates provably tighter error bounds compared to DPSGD across different behavior (i.e. convex and non-convex) of the objective function. The theoretical analysis further suggests that DDP leads to better utility at the cost of privacy, while random projection enables more efficient model learning. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets show that D2P2-SGD significantly enhances accuracy while maintaining privacy. Our code is available here."

Second, we show that such a model can be trained using pseudo-demonstrations â€“ arbitrary trajectories generated in simulation â€“ as a virtually infinite pool of training data.

Here we show that self-supervision alone can produce high-quality sentence embeddings, albeit slightly below those from state-of-the-art supervised models. We systematically compare several existing augmentation strategies for positive pair generation in contrastive learning and show that text crops strongly outperform popular dropout-based augmentation. Using text crops, well-performing embeddings can be obtained even when training from scratch without using pre-trained model weights, or when training a bare token embedding layer without any transformer architecture. Overall, we show that self-supervised learning allows rapid training of text embeddings of a given dataset."

We found that anesthesia decouples neural connectivity, shifting neurons from polysemantic (responding to multiple inputs) to monosemantic (responding to a single input), resulting in a lower-dimensional population code.

        "abstract": "Deep learning algorithms for object classification and 3D object pose estimation lack robustness to out-of-distribution factors such as synthetic stimuli, changes in weather conditions, and partial occlusion. Human vision, however, is typically much more robust to all these factors. This is arguably because human vision exploits 3D object representations which are invariant to most of these factors. Recently a class of 3D  compositional models have been developed where objects are represented in terms of 3D meshes, with typically 1000 vertices associated with learnt vertex features. These models have shown robustness in small-scale settings, involving 10 or 12 objects, but it is unclear that they can be scaled up to 100s of object classes. The main problem is that their training involves supervised contrastive learning on the mesh vertices representing the objects and requires each vertex to be contrasted with all other vertices, which scales quadratically with the vertex number. A newly available dataset with 3D annotations for 188 object classes allows us to address this scaling challenge. We present a strategy which exploits the compositionality of the objects, i.e. the independence of the feature vectors of the vertices, which greatly reduces the training time while also improving the performance of the algorithms. We first refactor the per-vertex contrastive learning into contrasting within class and between classes. Then we propose a process that dynamically decouples the contrast between classes which are rarely confused, and enhances the contrast between the vertices of classes that are most confused. Our large-scale 3D compositional model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on object classification and 3D pose estimation in a unified manner surpassing ViT and ResNet, but is also more robust to out-of-distribution testing including occlusion, weather conditions, and synthetic data. This paves the way for scalable 3D object understanding and opens exciting possibilities for applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and augmented reality."

However, integrating feasibility models efficiently into DRL pipelines in environments with continuous action spaces is non-trivial. We propose a novel strategy, termed action mapping, that leverages feasibility models to streamline the learning process. By decoupling the learning of feasible actions from policy optimization, action mapping allows DRL agents to focus on selecting the optimal action from a reduced feasible action set. We demonstrate through experiments that action mapping significantly improves training performance in constrained environments with continuous action spaces, especially with imperfect feasibility models."

LAIA-NLU contains 1,500 high-quality QA pairs, created through manual review.

To address these challenges, we propose a semantic-based candidate label generation method leveraging the GloVe dictionary, alongside a novel model, PGNA-PL (Prototype-Guided Noise-Augmented Partial Label Learning). It constructs stable emotion representations through prototypes and leverages a self-distillation mechanism to iteratively guide the classifier's disambiguation process.

This framework is both universal, as it can accommodate any algorithmic task, and simple, requiring only copying text from the context with small modifications.

Previous works have studied skill stitching through online RL, which is time-consuming and raises safety concerns when learning in the real world. In this work, we propose a fully offline approach to learn skill stitching. Given that the aggregated datasets from all skills provide diverse and exploratory data, which likely includes the necessary transitions for stitching skills, we train a dynamics model designed to generalize across skills to facilitate this process. Our method employs model predictive control (MPC) to stitch adjacent skills, using an ensemble of offline dynamics models and value functions. To mitigate overestimation issues inherent in models learned offline, we introduce a conservative approach that penalizes the uncertainty in model and value predictions. Our experimental results across various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach in comparison to baseline methods under offline settings."

Our approach, \\texttt{RARe}, fine-tunes a pre-trained model with in-context examples whose query is semantically similar to the target query. This can be applied to adapt various base architectures (i.e., decoder-only language models, retriever models) and consistently achieves performance gains of up to +2.72% nDCG across various open-domain retrieval datasets (BeIR, RAR-b). Particularly, we find \\texttt{RARe} exhibits stronger out-of-domain generalization compared to models using queries without in-context examples, similar to what is seen for in-context learning in LLMs. While our approach incurs additional computational cost to encode lengthier queries, the impact is less pronounced in large-corpus scenarios. We further provide analysis on the design choices of in-context example augmentation and lay the foundation for future work in this space."

        "abstract": "Oceans, covering more than 70% surfaces of our blue planets are less explored by the whole computer vision community. The scarcity of the labeled data is attributed to the most hindering issue. In this work, we propose a novel and comprehensive dataset called MarineMaid specifically designed for marine monitoring and understanding, including a wide spectrum of marine creatures. Based on the essential requirements of the marine research community, we adopt object detection and vision-language understanding as our two fundamental tasks. The former object detection could yield precise localization and category predictions for species identification and monitoring. Besides the sole category and BBOX predictions, the latter vision-language understanding generates redundant and comprehensive captions about biological traits required for domain experts. MarineMaid contains 12,873 fine-grained instance-captioning pairs and 42,217 bounding boxes annotated by domain experts. We have benchmarked 14 state-of-the-art algorithms on our MarineMaid dataset to reveal the strengths and limitations of existing general-purpose and domain-specific algorithms. The hierarchical and comprehensive experimental results provide valuable insights on how to develop practical and efficient marine visual perception algorithms to satisfy the domain requirements. To foster the further development of this direction, we will release our MarineMaid dataset with the acceptance of this paper."

        "abstract": "Masked Image Modeling has gained prominence as a powerful self-supervised learning approach for visual representation learning by reconstructing masked-out patches of images. However, the use of random spatial masking can lead to failure cases in which the learned features are not predictive of downstream labels. In this work, we introduce a novel masking strategy that targets principal components instead of image patches. The learning task then amounts to reconstructing the information of masked-out principal components. The principal components of a dataset contain more global information than patches, such that the information shared between the masked input and the reconstruction target should involve more high-level variables of interest. This property allows principal components to offer a more meaningful masking space, which manifests in improved quality of the learned representations. We provide empirical evidence across natural and medical datasets and demonstrate substantial improvements in image classification tasks. Our method thus offers a simple and robust data-driven alternative to traditional Masked Image Modelling approaches."

        "keywords": "Natural Language Processing, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning",
        "abstract": "The reduction of the computational and memory overhead associated with fine-tuning large language models remains a significant challenge for current research in natural language processing. Achieving an optimal balance between task performance, adaptability, and low VRAM requirement often presents a complex trade-off. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, have gained attention for their ability to reduce the number of trainable parameters while preserving task performance. However, they have not yet achieved a notable reduction in VRAM usage, which is still predominantly consumed by model weights and activations during backpropagation. In contrast, Ladder Side-Tuning (LST) has been proposed as an alternative that effectively reduces VRAM usage by freezing the backbone language model (BLM) and training only lightweight side networks. Nevertheless, this reduction in memory usage often results in a decline in performance, as LST typically exhibits inferior performance compared to PEFT methods on the same BLM. To address these limitations, we propose Symbiotic Tuning (SymTune), a novel approach that extracts intermediate outputs from the BLM and integrates symbiotic modules to enhance feature processing capabilities. This method avoids a direct trade-off between performance and VRAM efficiency, offering two key advantages: 1) robust performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, and 2) reduced VRAM consumption through an improved side-tuning architecture. The experimental results demonstrate that SymTune provides a scalable and memory-efficient solution for fine-tuning language models."

        "abstract": "Text-based Person Search (TBPS) in full images aims to locate a target pedestrian within uncropped images based on natural language descriptions. Existing TBPS methods typically rely on candidate region generation and cross-modal matching. However, in complex scenes,especially those with multiple pedestrians in the image.It is often challenging to distinguish the target pedestrian from the background or other individuals. This leads to limited generalization capabilities.\n To address these issues, we propose a new TBPS framework named ProtoDis-TBPS, which integrates three key components: Semantic Context Decoupling (SCD), Prototype Embedding Learning (PEL), and a Cross-modal Person Re-identification (ReID) module. Specifically, SCD enhances cross-modal feature discrimination by separating background and irrelevant contextual information. PEL improves the model's robustness in complex scenes by learning prototype features for pedestrian categories. Finally, the ReID module, based on a Transformer architecture, further boosts the accuracy of both text-based pedestrian detection and re-identification in full images.Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method presents a significant challenge to existing approaches in this field."
